# Playphone Round 3

This is a Game made for the third round of #playphone on the Hack Club Slack! Playphone is a community made game where others will contribute to this game in rounds, and at the end of it all, we will have an extremely polished game.

I did some behid the senes stuff to make level design easyier.
clouds and functionality(bounceing) is now attached to the tile on the tile map

spikes also now exist to kill the player.
