# Playphone Round 2

This is a Game made for the second round of #playphone on the Hack Club Slack! Playphone is a community made game where others will contribute to this game in rounds, and at the end of it all, we will have an extremely polished game.

Migeul being ever so gracious let me switch places with him so i got the second turn. I did alot of polishind of the base and alot of things that will be important for the game in the long run.

I've implemented :
- main menu
- controls menu
- xbox controller support
- end screen
- made everything like not blurry
- options menu
i also like made the goal estrogen (so woke ik)
